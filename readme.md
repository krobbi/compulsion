# About
Compulsion is a Minecraft Fabric mod that aims to be updated sporadically with
minor tweaks and fixes that improve the player's experience in transparent and
subtle ways. It is the successor to
[Endfix](https://github.com/krobbi/fabricmc-endfix), my first Minecraft mod,
and contains its feature set.

You may use this mod in mod packs without permission.

NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG.
