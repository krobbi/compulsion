# About
Compulsion is a Minecraft Fabric mod that aims to be updated sporadically with
minor tweaks and fixes that improve the player's experience in transparent and
subtle ways. It is the successor to
[Endfix](https://github.com/krobbi/fabricmc-endfix), my first Minecraft mod,
and is planned to include its feature set.

You may use this mod in mod packs without permission.

NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG.
